A selection of things I am available for. Please do [contact me](/contact) for more information!

### Music Arrangments

Arrangments for your new musical where you have the chords and melody down, or a string arrangment in your acoustic ballad, or a SATB Choir version of a pop song, or anything along these lines! I'm mainly interested in choral/orchestral Musical Theatre, but am open to pretty much anything. I work in Dorico and Sibelius.

### Sheet Music Preparation

If you have handwritten/rough sheet music or even no music at all, I can get it transcribed and looking beautiful and clear for a recording session or publication. I am well experienced in the Musical Theatre world, so am very familiar in all the conventions of the industry. As stated above, I work in Dorico and Sibelius.

### Music Direction

I have been in the music department for over 25 different shows and am available for positions such as MD, rehearsal pianist, pit pianist, keyboard Mainstage programmer. I have all my own equipment and am fully DBS checked.

### Everything Else

For example, any kind of music related tutoring: Piano lessons, Secondary School Music exams, music theory etc.  

Feel free to contact me with any other enquiries you think I may be interested in, even if I'm not available for that I may be able to refer you to someone who could.
